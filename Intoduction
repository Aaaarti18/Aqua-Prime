Introduction:
	
	Since long time, the rural areas in India are going through water crises problem .This has encouraged the water suppliers to supply water on a large scale to people living in these areas. But there is no management to supply water to these people on a daily basis. Moreover it is not possible for every person to stand in a queue just to pen down his order.Our team saw this problem and decide to overcome it.
	Our very first step was to build an application that could solve this water supply management problem . The main aim was to build an app that could be useful to both customers as well as the suppliers and there is no need to stand in a queue or there would neither be any mismanagement relating to payment or quantity of order.
	Hence this project is all about the efficient management of water supply which will not only overcome the management issue but also connect the customer and the supplier on a daily basis with just a click on their application.
